# Templates and Specifications

As a long-term research project, it is often necessary to develop new uniform and standardized data and metadata formats to enable the development of solutions.. As a basis for these solutions, specifications and templates are created in the Open Energy Family that are used during development. As a rule, user input is recorded in a standardized manner. During development, developers can assume that the data is available in a defined format.

These currently include the factsheets for recording information on framework conditions and models from energy system modelling, the Open Energy Metadata Format for creating comprehensive metadata for tabular data sets and the Open Energy Datamodel as a framework-specific approach for harmonizing relational data models to enable the comparability of data sets.

All of these specifications and templates were developed on the basis of the current state of the art and as part of research projects and are freely available and can be further developed.
