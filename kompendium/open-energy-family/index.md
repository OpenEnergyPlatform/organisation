# The Open Energy Family

Overview image....

Like many families, the Open Energy Family is large and growing continuously. Some family members are very well known and are in the foreground while others are rather small and inconspicuous. Some have their own repository while some are directly attached to other members. Together they make a strong family circle for working with open data and open science.
