# Open Energy Datamodel

A common open energy data model (oedatamodel) and datapackage format for energy and scenario data. This template data model for relational data was originally developed as part of open_MODEX and serves to harmonize the input and output data structure of different energy system models and thus make them comparable. This requires an effort that has to be implemented by the researchers themselves, since in most cases a data structure already exists that either has to be mapped into the oedatamodel format or entails a complete conversion to the format. More user-friendly solutions are currently being researched here.

In general, however, the format is not restrictive and is open to further developments or adaptations. The goal of using a standardized and widespread data model should not be lost sight of in order to ensure the comparability of the data.
