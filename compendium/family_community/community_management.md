# Community Management

## Community Manager

Community Management is critical for the success of the Open Energy Family. 
The Community Manager fosters a collaborative environment and communicates 
between the community and the development team. They gather feedback, 
prioritize requests, and organize events that facilitate engagement and 
collaboration. 
Effective Community Management ensures that the framework meets the needs of 
its users and adapts to the changing needs of the energy research community.

## Steering Committees

To accompany the ongoing development and success of the Community, 
two steering committees have been established: 
the OEO Steering Committee (OSO-SC) 
and the OEFamily Steering Committee (OEFamily-SC).
Both steering committees play a critical role in guiding the development 
of the Open Energy Family and the OEO. 
Their oversight and strategic direction help to ensure that the framework 
and ontology remain relevant and useful to the energy research community.

You can find the dates on the [Contact](../contact/) page.

### OEFamily-SC

The OEFamily-SC is responsible for the overall development and strategic 
direction of the Open Energy Family framework. 
The committee works closely with the core development team to ensure that the 
framework meets the needs of its users and remains aligned with the goals 
of the project. It meets regularly via conference calls and in-person meetings 
to exchange information and review planned and completed tasks.
