# Communication

## Contact

### GitHub

GitHub offers a solid base for our community to communicate and collaborate.<br>
We use the _GitHub Discussions_ and _GitHub Issues_.

We have different [_GitHub Teams_](https://github.com/orgs/OpenEnergyPlatform/teams)
to coordinate the development.<br>
The link provided above is accessible exclusively to members of our community. 
To gain an understanding of the teams and their respective responsibilities, we recommend reading our [Developer Role](collaborative_development.md#github-teams) overview.


If you want to participate in the development, we are happy to add you to the 
corresponding teams.

Please note to always follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) on all channels


### Contact Form

The OEP offers a contact form as a direct channel for reaching out to our 
communication experts. 
Whether you have questions, feedback, suggestions, or collaboration inquiries, 
we welcome your message. Our team is committed to ensuring that your voice is 
heard and that your needs are met promptly and efficiently.

On the [OEP Contact Form](https://openenergy-platform.org/contact/) you'll find 
a user-friendly form where you can provide us with the necessary information. 
The more details you provide, the better we can understand your requirements 
and tailor our response accordingly.
