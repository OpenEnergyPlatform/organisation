# Energy Databus

The Open Energy Databus is being developed by DBpedia and is a transformative platform for agile data integration, collaboration, and automation via a structured metadata Knowledge Graph. The deployment that is available specifically for the Open Energy Family acts as an additional semantic layer over the various existing databases to extend the underlying rigid metadata schemas and enable search, persistent IDs and provenance tracking of scientific results.
