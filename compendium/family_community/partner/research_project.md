## open_eGo

### General

The aim of the open_eGo project is to develop and use models to generate 
cost-optimised solutions for the expansion and conversion of the electricity 
grid for the energy transition. The open-source tool landscape created around 
the eGo grid planning tool can model all voltage levels in Germany, 
simulate the basic functioning of the electricity market taking into account 
the physical AC load flow behaviour and simultaneously optimise grid and storage 
expansion in an integrated way. 

### Tasks

The Open Energy Platform was created within the research project, with the aim 
of enabling the systematised, cross-model use of open energy data. 
In addition all input data and results have been published on the OEP and the 
first version of the OEMetadata has been created.
