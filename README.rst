Open Energy Family - Organisation
==================================

This repository is dedicated to discussions and decisions regarding the Open Energy Family (OEFamily).
The OEFamily is a dynamic collection of tools and information designed to support working with energy-related data.
Our community is collaborative, and we openly develop everything.
Our goal is to provide users with access to the latest information and tools, so they can make informed decisions about energy.
For more information about the OEFamily and the OEP, please visit our website at https://openenergy-platform.org/about/.

The Open Energy Family Members
-------------------------------

Like many families, the Open Energy Family is a vast and ever-expanding community.
Some of our family members are well-known and prominent, while others may be less visible but equally important.
Some have their own dedicated repository, while others are integrated within larger projects.
However, we are all connected by our shared goal of advancing Open Science in energy system research.
Together, we form a strong and supportive circle, dedicated to the development and dissemination of cutting-edge tools and information that promote the efficient and sustainable use of energy.
