# Research Projects

The research projects that are/were involved in the development of the Open Energy Family are presented here.

## open_eGo

### General

The aim of the open_eGo project is to develop and use models to generate
cost-optimised solutions for the expansion and conversion of the electricity
grid for the energy transition. The open-source tool landscape created around
the eGo grid planning tool can model all voltage levels in Germany,
simulate the basic functioning of the electricity market taking into account
the physical AC load flow behaviour and simultaneously optimise grid and storage
expansion in an integrated way.

### Tasks

The Open Energy Platform was created within the research project, with the aim
of enabling the systematised, cross-model use of open energy data.
In addition all input data and results have been published on the OEP and the
first version of the OEMetadata has been created.

## open_FRED  

open feed-in time series based on a Renewable Energy Database

### General

In open_FRED, the requirements, assumptions and possibilities of energy system analysis and climate models are examined in order to create high-quality, transparent and citable data sets. These are then linked to open source simulation models that generate feed-in time series of fluctuating renewable energies.

### Tasks

The aim of open_FRED is to create a data basis for energy system analyses with a uniform standard. For this purpose, the project made availlable relevant data sets for power plant, geospatial and basic data. The result is a special weather data set with high spatial and temporal resolution that meets the requirements of the feed-in models pvlib, windpowerlib and hydropowerlib.

## SzenarienDB

### General

The aim of SzenarienDB is to create a publicly accessible database on which scenario data, i.e. all data related to a scenario calculation, are summarised and published. This includes both input and output data of the calculation. In addition, the data is linked to the model descriptions.

### Tasks

The Open Energy Platform (OEP) has been reworked and redesigned. As a major output, the Open Energy Ontology (OEO) has been created and developed collaboratively. This is significantly improving transparency and the exchange of scenario data.

## SIROP

Automated comparison of energy scenarios

### General

The SIROP project aims to enable and (partially) automate scenario interoperability and scenario comparisons. This is an important step towards more comprehensible and reproducible energy system research. SIROP builds on the predecessor project SzenarienDB.

### Tasks

In order to use the OEO, the Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG) is beeing developed. As part of the Open Energy Family it is enabling transparency, traceability and reusability of results in energy system research. It is the basis for new Factsheets and a scenario comparision tool. In addition, the OEP is extended by workshop concepts and tutorials to make everything understandable and accessible.

## open_MODEX

Model experiment to compare and determine synergy potentials of open-source frameworks in energy system analysis

### General

In the open_MODEX project, five open source frameworks for energy system analysis are being examined and compared with each other. The aim is to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the individual frameworks and to analyse commonalities, differences and possible synergies between the them.

### Tasks

The aim is to develop open modelling frameworks and use the OEP to give access to the scenario data. Most of the input data and alls results from open_MODEX are available on the OEP under open licences. The main result is the development of the Open Energy Datamodel (OEDatamodel) and an API for automated data access in the models.

## LOD-GEOSS

Linked Open Data and use of the Global Earth Observation System GEOSS in energy system analysis

### General

In the LOD-GEOSS project, a networked database concept is to be developed on the basis of Linked Open Data (LOD) and the Semantic Web for input and result data of modelling in energy system analysis. In addition, a connection to the global earth observation system (GEOSS) will be realised, especially for spatio-temporally resolved input data.

### Tasks

The Energy Databus is created as a data publication and search index. All data of the OEP will be registered.
