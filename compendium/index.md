## About the Open Energy Family
The Open Energy Family is a comprehensive open science framework that aims to 
facilitate the transition to a more sustainable and renewable energy system. 
The project is focused on creating and promoting open-source technologies, 
publicly accessible data, and transparent methods for energy system modeling. 
Its ultimate goal is to support collaborative research on solutions for 
research data management and modeling in the field of energy systems.

Thanks to its commitment to openness, transparency, and accessibility, 
the Open Energy Family has already achieved considerable success 
in the research field. 
It is continuously being developed through state-funded research projects 
to improve its capabilities and effectiveness.

The framework's emphasis on collaboration and community-driven innovation 
makes it an essential tool for researchers, scientists, and policymakers 
working towards a more sustainable energy future. 
By providing a platform for sharing ideas, data, and methods, 
the Open Energy Family aims to accelerate progress towards a more sustainable 
and equitable energy system.
