# Factsheets

The Factsheets on the OEP are a standardized collection and presentation of
information about frameworks, software, and scenarios used in climate and
energy system modelling.
The use of interactive fields and pre-defined responses is designed to make
it easy to insert data and filter for existing entries.

## Framework Factsheet

The Frameworks Factsheets are designed to show the different software frameworks
used for modeling energy system and energy system analysis.
These frameworks offer a systematic approach to simulate, analyze,
and sometimes optimize energy systems comprising diverse energy sources,
conversion technologies, transmission networks, and consumption patterns.
The factsheets aim to provide insights into the methodologies and applications
of these frameworks.

## Model Factsheet

The [model factsheet](http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000277) characterizes models used in energy system analysis in a structured way regarding important characteristics, such as their scope and [license](https://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00020015) and their developing [institutions](https://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000238). You are developing a model? Then you can inform about its characteristics [here](https://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000238). The models available as a factsheet can be integrated as an element into a [scenario bundle](https://openenergy-platform.org/scenario-bundles/main) which weaves together important information about [scenarios](http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000364), such as the model used for conducting a [scenario projection](https://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00010262), [data](https://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/IAO_0000027) provided on the OEP, and [publications](https://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00020012).
