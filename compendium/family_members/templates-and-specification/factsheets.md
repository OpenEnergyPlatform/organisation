# Factsheets

The Factsheets on the OEP are a standardized collection and presentation of 
information about frameworks, software, and scenarios used in climate and 
energy system modelling. 
The use of interactive fields and pre-defined responses is designed to make 
it easy to insert data and filter for existing entries.

## Framework Factsheet

The Frameworks Factsheets are designed to show the different software frameworks 
used for modeling energy system and energy system analysis. 
These frameworks offer a systematic approach to simulate, analyze, 
and sometimes optimize energy systems comprising diverse energy sources, 
conversion technologies, transmission networks, and consumption patterns. 
The factsheets aim to provide insights into the methodologies and applications 
of these frameworks.

## Scenario Factsheet

The Scenario Factsheets provide some dedicated information about specific
scenarios for which projection data is available on the OEP.
They are based on the concepts available in the Open Energy Ontology (OEO)
and the Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG).
This enables the OEP to include information on the scenario projection
data available in the database, the corresponding frameworks and models applied,
and the study context. 
The factsheets will make these relations visible and usable.
