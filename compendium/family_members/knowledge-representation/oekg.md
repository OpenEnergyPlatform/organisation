# Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG)

The Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG) is a network of entities, their semantic types, properties, and relationships for the energy system analysis domain. It is based on the RDF standard and uses the Turtle format.
Fundamentally, the development is according to the Open Energy Ontology (OEO).

## Structure

The structure of the OEKG is based on graph of nodes and relations that are stored in a database. While the Open Energy Ontology offers a **comprehensive understanding** of the energy domain and a structured framework of interconnected concepts. Furthermore, the open energy knowledge graph has been carefully designed to effectively present **detailed information about specific instances** and also store these specific instances.

The following  illustrates a generic model of the [scenario bundles](../templates-and-specification/scenario-bundles.md) which is the main instance available in the OEKG.
