### user stories

* I as Alix Agency want to commission a study on Germany and quickly need to find information on institutions that created climate- and energy scenarios for Germany, find the corresponding studies and learn about the scenarios contained in these studies (SIROP).  For that I need a powerful search engine, that finds institutions and their contributions to the OEP in a second.
* I as Alix Agency want to compare two models using the model and framework factsheets to decide on who to grant a contract. Therefore I need a quick overview of the factsheets that allows me to scan for relevant information (OEP).
* I as Alix Agency need to define how the data and metadata will need to be published in a research project, so that the requirements of my agency are fulfilled. For that I need a quick and easy overview how to contribute these data to the platform in a proper way to share with my contractors.
* I as Alix Agency need to confirm that a contractor provided the information to the OEP as stated in the contract, so that final payment can be made. For that I need a powerful search engine, that finds institutions and their contributions to the OEP in a second.
