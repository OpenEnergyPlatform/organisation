# The Open Energy Family Community

The Open Energy Family is developed by researchers from 
various institutions in different research projects. 
This open development approach ensures that the framework continues 
to evolve beyond the duration of individual projects. 
As a result, the Open Energy Family has fostered a vibrant community of 
researchers and users, including interested individuals and employees from companies.

While there is often significant overlap between the groups of researchers 
and users, it is still relevant to distinguish between those who develop the 
framework and those who use it. 
This is especially true when it comes to understanding how users collaborate 
in the development process. To facilitate this, the community is subdivided 
based on their roles and responsibilities, allowing for greater clarity and 
coordination.

Overall, this collaborative approach to development and community-building has 
been a critical factor in the success of the Open Energy Family. By encouraging 
participation from a diverse range of stakeholders, the framework has been able 
to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of the energy research community.
