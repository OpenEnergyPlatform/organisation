# Collaborative Development

Researchers who participate in the development of the Open Energy Family are 
known as "core developers". Their work involves capturing scientific processes 
that can be implemented in software, gathering requirements, and developing 
processes or artifacts such as software code and test results. 
Additionally, they contribute to the development of specific Family Members, 
like the ontology, drawing on their expertise in fields such as energy systems. 
Core developers collaborate with the open community to improve and maintain the 
software and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

To ensure the transparency and accessibility of the development process, 
all developments are publicly planned, executed, and documented on GitHub and 
in development meetings. 
Core developers also have direct or indirect access to internal systems such as 
servers that cannot be publicly accessible for security reasons.

While the core developers are responsible for the bulk of the development work, 
the Open Energy Family is open to participation from anyone interested in 
contributing. 
This includes stakeholders such as other researchers in the energy system 
domain who may not be directly involved in the research projects but have an 
interest in the tools and services offered by the framework.

As the work of core developers requires significant effort, funding is crucial 
to ensure their continued participation. It is therefore essential that 
individuals are deployed as part of a research project that provides adequate 
funding for their work. By embracing the collaborative spirit of Open Science, 
the Open Energy Family is able to leverage the expertise and contributions of a 
diverse range of stakeholders to create a more sustainable and 
equitable energy system.
