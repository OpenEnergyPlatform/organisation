# Welcome to the Open Energy Compendium

The purpose of the Open Energy Family compendium is to provide an overall view of the framework. The aim is to present content in a short and easy-to-understand form to simplify the introduction to the extensive architecture of the Open Energy Family. The content then links to the technical repositories or the tools that can be used.  In this way, the compendium also serves as a concrete guide through the framework and helps to better understand the relationships between the individual components.

## About the Open Energy Family

The Open Energy Family is a comprehensive open science framework that aims to
facilitate the transition to a more sustainable and renewable energy system.
The project is focused on creating and promoting open-source technologies,
publicly accessible data, and transparent methods for energy system modeling.
Its ultimate goal is to support collaborative research on solutions for
research data management and modeling in the field of energy systems.

Thanks to its commitment to openness, transparency, and accessibility,
the Open Energy Family has already achieved considerable success
in the research field.
It is continuously being developed through state-funded research projects
to improve its capabilities and effectiveness.

The framework's emphasis on collaboration and community-driven innovation
makes it an essential tool for researchers, scientists, and policymakers
working towards a more sustainable energy future.
By providing a platform for sharing ideas, data, and methods,
the Open Energy Family aims to accelerate progress towards a more sustainable
and equitable energy system.

## About NFDI4Energy:

NFDI4Energy, started in 2023, aims to improve research data management in energy research and promote open science practices among researchers.

The consortium is developing five key services to address research data management in energy research and promote open science.

To accomplish their objectives, NFDI4Energy collaborates with and contributes to the Open Energy Family. In the coming years, they plan to enhance the Open Energy Family by adding new features and capabilities. This site will be constantly updated with news about new services developed by NFDI4Energy.
